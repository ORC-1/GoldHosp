INSTALLATION

Make sure that the target environment for ODsys has Python 2.7 or 3.2.2 and Django 1.6.5 or 1.9 installed and running correctly.



Unzip the compressed folder containing the ODsys application into a suitable directory of your choice.

Once that is done, open a command prompt window (Windows) or a Terminal window (Mac OS).

Navigate to the folder where the application was opened and traverse deeper through the directory until you are in the same directory that contains the file called manage.py.

Type in the command "python manage.py runserver" on your command prompt or Terminal window and run it.

Take the HTTP address from the line beginning with "Starting development server at...".Put that web address into a web browser of your choice and go to it. The URL you enter should look something like this: http://127.0.0.1:8000

You now have the ODsys application running. Enjoy!
